CLESOLVEPKG 

Coded for a numerical lab at uni bonn

Contains a "Model" class to specify reaction networks.
Model has members:
   reactants: the reactants on the l.h.s. of the chemical reactions,
   products: the products "...",
   rates: The rates of the reactions,
   initial_vals: The amount of biological species at beginning of simulation,
   get_propensities: A function that returns the array of propensities, given a species vector y and rates

Contains the functions:
1. solve_cle(model:Model,t_span:np.array,num_solver:int)
   Takes an instance of model and time during which to simulate.
   For num_solver = 0 uses custom Euler-Maruyama method.
   For num_solver = 1 uses sdeint.itoint function to simulate CLE.
2. euler_maruyama(y0,t_span:np.array,f,G)
   y0 as initial value at time t = 0
   t_span: the time window to be simulated
   f: the deterministic part of the SDE
   G: The part of the SDE containing the Wiener process
   -> returns array of species data calculated w.r.t. times in t_span
